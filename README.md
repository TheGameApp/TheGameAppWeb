## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheGameApp/TheGameAppWeb.git
   cd TheGameAppWeb
   ```

2. **Serve the application**

   Since the application uses ES6 modules, you'll need to serve it through a local web server:

   Using Python:

   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

   Or using Node.js with a package like `serve`:

   ```bash
   npx serve
   ```

3. **Open in your browser**

   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port provided by your server)

## 🎨 Design System

TheGameApp uses a consistent design system with carefully selected colors, typography, and components.

### 🎭 Typography

We use the **Clash Display** font family in various weights:

- Clash Display Extralight (200)
- Clash Display Light (300)
- Clash Display Regular (400)
- Clash Display Medium (500)
- Clash Display Semibold (600)
- Clash Display Bold (700)

### 🌈 Color Palette

- **Primary Colors**: Lavender, Cyan, White
- **Secondary Colors**: Gray, Dark Gray
- **Accent Colors**: Red, Yellow, Green

## 🌐 Internationalization

TheGameApp supports multiple languages:

- 🇺🇸 English (default)
- 🇪🇸 Spanish

The application automatically detects the user's browser language and applies the appropriate translations. Users can also manually switch between languages using the language selector in the header.

## 🧩 Clean Architecture Principles

1. **Framework Independence**: The application core doesn't depend on any external frameworks
2. **Testability**: Business rules can be tested without UI, database, or external elements
3. **UI Independence**: The interface can change without affecting the rest of the system
4. **Database Independence**: Storage technology can be swapped without affecting business rules
5. **External Agency Independence**: Business rules know nothing about the outside world
